      <p>You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbSpells0000000.JournalEntryPage.b2QVn25z2N1ykWpf]{chapter
      7} for the rules on power system. The information below details how you
      use those rules with Cleric spells, which appear on the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbSpells0000000.JournalEntryPage.SkHptN2PTzFGDaEj]{Cleric
      power list}.</p><p><strong>Basic Powers.</strong> You know three basic powers of
      your choice from the Cleric power list.
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplGuidance00]{Guidance},
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplSacredFlam]{Sacred Flame}, and
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplThaumaturg]{Thaumaturgy} are
      recommended.</p><p>Whenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one
      of your basic powers with another basic power of your choice from the Cleric spell
      list.</p><p>When you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn another
      basic power of your choice from the Cleric power list, as shown in the
      Basic Powers column of the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbCleric0000000.JournalEntryPage.acPyA6A4DQBSnuZB#class-features]{Cleric
      Features} table.</p><p><strong>Power Uses.</strong> The Cleric Features
      table shows how many power uses you have to cast your level 1+ spells.
      You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long
      Rest.</p><p><strong>Prepared Powers of Level 1+.</strong> You prepare the
      list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this
      feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Cleric power list.
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplBless00000]{Bless},
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplCureWounds]{Cure Wounds},
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplGuidingBol]{Guiding Bolt}, and
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplShieldofFa]{Shield of Faith}
      are recommended.</p><p>The number of spells on your list increases as you
      gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Powers column of the Cleric
      Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells
      from the Cleric power list until the number of spells on your list matches
      the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which
      you have power uses. For example, if you're a level 3 Cleric, your list
      of prepared powers can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any
      combination.</p><p>If another Cleric feature gives you spells that you
      always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of
      spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count
      as Cleric spells for you.</p><p><strong>Changing Your Prepared Powers.
      </strong>Whenever you finish a Full Rest, you can change your list of
      prepared powers, replacing any of the spells there with other Cleric
      spells for which you have power uses.</p><p><strong>Power System Ability.
      </strong>Wisdom is your power system ability for your Cleric
      spells.</p><p><strong>Power System Focus. </strong>You can use a Holy
      Symbol as a Power System Focus for your Cleric spells.</p>
