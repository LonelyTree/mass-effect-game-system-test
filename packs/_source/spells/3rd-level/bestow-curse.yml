      <p>You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving
      throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. When you cast this
      spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on
      ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.</li>

      <li>While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against
      you.</li>

      <li>While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start
      of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing
      nothing.</li>

      <li>While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8
      necrotic damage to the target.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>A remove curse spell ends this effect. At the DM's option, you may
      choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than
      those described above. The DM has final say on such a curse's
      effect.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> If you cast this spell
      using a power use of 4th level or higher, the duration is maintained power,
      up to 10 minutes. If you use a power use of 5th level or higher, the
      duration is 8 hours. If you use a power use of 7th level or higher, the
      duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level power use, the spell lasts
      until it is dispelled. Using a power use of 5th level or higher grants a
      duration that doesn't require maintained power.</p>
