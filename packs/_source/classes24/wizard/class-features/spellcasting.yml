      <p>As a student of arcane magic, you have learned to cast spells. See the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbSpells0000000.JournalEntryPage.b2QVn25z2N1ykWpf]{rules
      on power system}. The information below details how you use those rules
      with Wizard spells, which appear in the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbSpells0000000.JournalEntryPage.6AnqLUowgdsqMFvz]{Wizard
      power list}.</p><p><strong>Basic Powers.</strong> You know three Wizard
      basic powers of your choice.
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplLight00000]{Light},
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplMageHand00]{Mage Hand}, and
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplRayofFrost]{Ray of Frost} are
      recommended. Whenever you finish a Full Rest, you can replace one of your
      basic powers from this feature with another Wizard basic power of your
      choice.</p><p>When you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn another
      Wizard basic power of your choice, as shown in the Basic Powers column of the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbWizard0000000.JournalEntryPage.g7cMRWzsgAsEF7zC#class-features]{Wizard
      Features table}.</p><p><strong>Power List. </strong>Your wizardly
      apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your
      power list. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages,
      and can be read only by you or someone casting
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplIdentify00]{Identify}. You
      determine the book's appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome
      or a collection of vellum bound with twine.</p><p>The book contains the
      level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your
      choice. @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplDetectMagi]{Detect
      Magic}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplFeatherFal]{Feather
      Fall}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplMageArmor0]{Mage Armor},
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplMagicMissi]{Magic Missile},
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplSleep00000]{Sleep}, and
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplThunderwav]{Thunderwave} are
      recommended.</p><p>Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two
      Wizard spells of your choice to your power list. Each of these spells must
      be of a level for which you have power uses, as shown in the Wizard
      Features table. The spells are the culmination of arcane research you do
      regularly.</p><p><strong>Power Uses.</strong> The Wizard Features table
      shows how many power uses you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You
      regain all expended slots when you finish a Long
      Rest.</p><p><strong>Prepared Powers of Level 1+.</strong> You prepare the
      list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this
      feature. To do so, choose four spells from your power list. The chosen
      spells must be of a level for which you have power uses.</p><p>The number
      of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in
      the Prepared Powers column of the Wizard Features table. Whenever that
      number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of
      spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells
      must be of a level for which you have power uses. For example, if you're
      a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared powers can include six spells of
      levels 1 and 2 in any combination, chosen from your power list.</p><p>If
      another Wizard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared,
      those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with
      this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Wizard spells for
      you.</p><p><strong>Changing Your Prepared Powers.</strong> Whenever you
      finish a Full Rest, you can change your list of prepared powers, replacing
      any of the spells there with spells from your
      power list.</p><p><strong>Power System Ability.</strong> Intelligence is
      your power system ability for your Wizard
      spells.</p><p><strong>Power System Focus. </strong>You can use an Arcane
      Focus or your power list as a Power System Focus for your Wizard
      spells.</p>
