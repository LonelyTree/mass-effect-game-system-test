    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 6th level, your damaging basic powers affect even creatures
      that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving
      throw against your basic power, the creature takes half the basic power's damage
      (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the basic power.</p>
