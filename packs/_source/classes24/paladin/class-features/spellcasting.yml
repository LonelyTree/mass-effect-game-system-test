      <p>You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbSpells0000000.JournalEntryPage.b2QVn25z2N1ykWpf]{rules
      on power system}. The information below details how you use those rules
      with Paladin spells, which appear in the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbSpells0000000.JournalEntryPage.8yD9Jgp404hfZ9ie]{Paladin
      power list}.</p><p><strong>Power Uses.</strong> The
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbPaladin000000.JournalEntryPage.A34CXe4HdzXHoBEl#class-features]{Paladin
      Features table} shows how many power uses you have to cast your level 1+
      spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long
      Rest.</p><p><strong>Prepared Powers of Level 1+.</strong> You prepare the
      list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this
      feature. To start, choose two level 1 Paladin spells. <em>Heroism</em> and
      <em>Searing Smite</em> are recommended.</p><p>The number of spells on your
      list increases as you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared Powers
      column of the Paladin Features table. Whenever that number increases,
      choose additional Paladin spells until the number of spells on your list
      matches the number in the Paladin Features table. The chosen spells must
      be of a level for which you have power uses. For example, if you're a
      level 5 Paladin, your list of prepared powers can include six Paladin
      spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.</p><p>If another Paladin
      feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't
      count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but
      those spells otherwise count as Paladin spells for
      you.</p><p><strong>Changing Your Prepared Powers.</strong> Whenever you
      finish a Full Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another
      Paladin spell for which you have power uses.</p><p><strong>Power System
      Ability. </strong>Charisma is your power system ability for your Paladin
      spells.</p><p><strong>Power System Focus. </strong>You can use a Holy
      Symbol as a Power System Focus for your Paladin spells.</p>
